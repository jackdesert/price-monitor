Q: Why is there a table named simpletire_aggregates?
   Why not just generate these aggregates on the fly?
A: When moving to the $15/year VPS at snowvps.com,
   running the aggregate query took about 15 seconds
   in postgres.
   (On my local machine, it took two seconds.)
   Different options were considered for speeding up this process:
   1. Tune postgres
   2. Cache each page or each query.
   3. Add some denormalized fields to the simpletire_tire
      table such that those could be queried.

   Then along came the idea to simply store the results of the
   aggregation in a separate table and update it a few times a day.
   That way the normalized data model remains as it is,
   AND we get fast access to the data that we use.
